## One-click Download
One-click downloads for Windows 10, OSX Catalina and Ubuntu 18.04 are available as assets on https://github.com/swillems/ion_networks/releases. These only include the GUI (graphical user interface) with limited functionality.

## Installation
The ion-networks repository was developed on a [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/) with the [python 3.8](https://docs.python.org/3.8/) language. It is likely to function on other (UNIX-based) systems as well, but this has not been fully verified. OS X seems to be compatible and Windows can use a subsystem for linux.

### Windows 10
For Windows users, the recommended approach is to install a [Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) with Ubuntu 18.04 by following [these steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). After the WSL has been installed and a user account has been created, close the WSL and download and install [MobaXterm v11.1](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html) or higher. Open MobaXterm and from within open the WSL by clicking the WSL icon on the left of the window. Now, follow the installation steps for Ubuntu 18.04 within the MobaXterm WSL.

### OS X Catalina
Installation and usage has been verified on (OS X Catalina 10.15.6)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Catalina]. Download and install `wget` and `git` with [brew](https://brew.sh/). Follow the linux installation steps afterwards.

### Ubuntu 18.04
This repository requires python to be run within a [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) environment. The following one-line command will install Miniconda3 (only if this is not installed yet), followed by the installation of the ion-networks repository by [downloading the ion-networks installation script](https://github.com/swillems/ion_networks/tree/master/install/install.sh) and running the install script at the desired location (this path should be chosen by the user). Note that this includes a test of the installation with a small data excerpt from [PXD001240](http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001240). This data is relatively small (<50MB), but a full test analysis will require roughly 2GB of space and 5-60 minutes depending on your system...

```bash
# mkdir /desired/path/where/to/install/ion_networks/
# cd /desired/path/where/to/install/ion_networks/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swillems/ion_networks/master/install/install.sh && sh install.sh && rm install.sh
sh ion_networks/install/test.sh
```

If the ion-networks repository needs to be updated, [download](https://github.com/swillems/ion_networks/tree/master/install/update.sh) and/or run the ```update.sh``` bash script contained in the [install](https://github.com/swillems/ion_networks/tree/master/install) folder of the ion-networks repository.

### From source or with PyPi
Users that want more control of the installation can do this from source as well by following these steps:
* [Optional] Create a virtual environment or conda environment and activate it
* [Optional] Install [MS2PIP](https://github.com/compomics/ms2pip_c), taking your OS into account
* From PyPi:
  * Install ion-networks: `pip install ion_networks` or [Optional] `pip install 'ion_networks[ms2pip]'`
* From source:
  * Download the ion-networks github repo: `git clone https://github.com/swillems/ion_networks.git`
  * Install ion-networks: `pip install './ion_networks'` or [Optional] `pip install './ion_networks[ms2pip]'`




## Usage
Four basic modules have been implemented for the analysis of ion-networks:

1. Convert
2. Create
3. Evidence
4. Show

These modules can be run either with a [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) or through a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

### Windows 10
For Windows users, a (desktop) shortcut can be created in Windows that automatically runs the ion-networks GUI within the MobaXterm WSL. This can be done by opening MobaXterm and pressing the *session* button on the top left. Select the rightmost tab *WSL* and set the Linux distribution to Ubuntu in the *Basic WSL settings* tab. Click the *Advanced WSL settings* tab and copy ```ion_networks gui``` to the *Execute the following commands at startup* window. Finally, click the *Bookmark settings* tab and change the *Session name* to e.g. *ion_network_gui*. Click the *Create a desktop shortcut to this session* button and select both options *Hide terminal on startup* and *Close MobaXterm on exit* before pressing *OK* in this popup. Confirm the session settings with *OK*. A pop-up with the GUI running should have appeared in your taskbar, allowing you to test the installation. For subsequent use, double-clicking the Windows desktop icon suffices to run the ion-networks GUI as a stand-alone program.

### Ubuntu 18.04 and OS X Catalina
The ion-networks software can be run within a terminal with the command ```ion_networks``` (this alias is set by default during installation). Possible commands are:

```
Usage: ion_networks [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Analysis of LC-[...]-MSMS data with ion-networks.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  convert   Convert various input formats to unified input.
  create    Create ion-networks from unified input.
  evidence  Collect evidence for ion-networks.
  gui       Graphical user interface to analyse ion-networks.
  show      Show and browse ion-networks.
```

Each command then comes with its own help function through ```ion_networks COMMAND -h```.

Typically, a workflow looks as follows:

```bash
ion_networks convert -i data_folder/centroided_data/experiment_x -o project_folder/experiment_x/ion_networks/ -d HDMSE -l project_folder/experiment_x/ion_networks/log.txt
ion_networks create -i project_folder/experiment_x/ion_networks/ -l project_folder/experiment_x/ion_networks/log.txt
ion_networks evidence -i project_folder/experiment_x/ion_networks/ -l project_folder/experiment_x/ion_networks/log.txt
ion_networks show -i project_folder/experiment_x/ion_networks/ -l project_folder/experiment_x/ion_networks/log.txt
```

Alternatively, a GUI can be used by running the command ```ion_networks gui```.
